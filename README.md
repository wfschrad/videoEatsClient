# Video Eats
Video Eats is an app that allows users to search for video reviews (primarily) and text reviews for restaurants. 
They can sign in, search for restaurants by name or tag, leave a review, and more!
To accomplish this task, we used express.js, node.js, the pug template engine, and the sequelize cli.
